  "content": "This markdown file appears to be a soil analysis report generated by the SWATGenXApp software. Here's a summary of its contents:\n\n**Report Overview**\n\nThe report provides an analysis of the soil characteristics for a specified region (Lat [44.0315, 44.6131], Lon [-85.1355, -84.2785]) using the Gridded Soil Survey Geographic (gSSURGO) database.\n\n**Soil Characteristics Summary**\n\n* Dominant soil texture: Sand\n* Texture composition:\n\t+ Sand content: 72.4%\n\t+ Silt content: 12.1%\n\t+ Clay content: 9.3%\n* Soil fertility level: Moderate\n* Description: Moderately fertile soils requiring standard amendments for good productivity\n\n**Soil Fertility Components**\n\nThe report provides a table summarizing the soil fertility components, including:\n\n* pH: 4.82 (acidic)\n* Organic Carbon: 6.61% (high)\n* Available Water Capacity: 0.122 cm/cm (moderate)\n* Soil texture: Sand\n* Drainage: Good\n* Nutrient retention: Low\n\n**Soil Parameter Statistics**\n\nThe report provides a table summarizing the statistics for various soil parameters, including:\n\n* Mean and median values\n* Minimum and maximum values\n* Standard deviation and coefficient of variation\n* Correlation coefficients between different parameters\n\n**Limitations and Recommendations**\n\nThe report identifies several limitations and recommends corrective actions, such as:\n\n* Soil depth limitations: shallow soil areas should be chosen for shallow-rooted crops or raised beds.\n* Rock content limitations: consider rock removal or selecting crops tolerant of rocky soils.\n* Drainage limitations: install drainage systems or select water-tolerant crops in poorly drained areas.\n* pH limitations: apply lime to increase soil pH for better nutrient availability.\n\n**Data Source and Methodology**\n\nThe report is based on the gSSURGO database, which provides soil information at a 250m resolution. The analysis involves extraction of soil data, statistical analysis, soil texture classification, assessment of soil fertility and limitations, and generation of visualizations and spatial maps.\n\n**Data Export**\n\nThe complete dataset has been exported to CSV format for further analysis: [soil_data.csv](soil_data.csv)\n\nOverall, this report provides a comprehensive analysis of the soil characteristics for the specified region, highlighting areas of concern and recommending corrective actions to optimize crop growth and soil health.",

  "content": "This report provides an in-depth analysis of the soil characteristics and properties in a specific region. Here's a summary of the main findings:\n\n**Region Overview**\n\nThe study area covers a region with latitude between 44.0315 and 44.6131, and longitude between -85.1355 and -84.2785.\n\n**Soil Characteristics Summary**\n\n* Dominant soil texture: Sand\n* Soil fertility level: Moderate\n* Description: Moderately fertile soils requiring standard amendments for good productivity\n\n**Soil Fertility Components**\n\nThe report assesses various soil parameters, including pH, organic carbon, available water capacity, and nutrient retention. The results indicate:\n\n* pH: Acidic (4.82), may require liming\n* Organic Carbon: High (6.61%), indicates high fertility and good soil structure\n* Available Water Capacity: Moderate (0.122 cm/cm)\n* Soil Texture: Sand, affects drainage and nutrient retention\n\n**Soil Parameter Statistics**\n\nThe report provides detailed statistics for various soil parameters, including mean, median, minimum, maximum, standard deviation, and coefficient of variation.\n\n**Spatial Distribution Maps**\n\nThe report includes maps showing the spatial distribution of key soil parameters across the study area.\n\n**Soil Limitations**\n\nThe report identifies several limitations, including:\n\n* Shallow soil (<50cm): 0.0%\n* High rock content (>15%): 0.0%\n* Poor drainage: 0.1%\n* Acidic soils (pH<5.5): 60.9%\n* Salinity: Slight\n\n**Soil Management Recommendations**\n\nBased on the analysis, the report recommends:\n\n1. Apply lime to increase soil pH for better nutrient availability\n2. Apply fertilizers in smaller, more frequent doses to prevent nutrient leaching\n\n**Parameter Correlations**\n\nThe report presents a correlation matrix showing relationships between various soil parameters.\n\n**Data Source and Methodology**\n\nThe report is based on the Gridded Soil Survey Geographic (gSSURGO) database, which provides soil information at a 250m resolution. The analysis involves extraction of soil data for the specified region, statistical analysis, and generation of visualizations and spatial maps.\n\nOverall, this report provides valuable insights into the soil characteristics and properties in the study area, which can inform agricultural management decisions and land use planning.",

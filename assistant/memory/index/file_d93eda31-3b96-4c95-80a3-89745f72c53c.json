  "content": "This report is a comprehensive analysis of solar radiation, wind speed, and relative humidity data from the National Solar Radiation Database (NSRDB). The report provides an in-depth examination of various climate variables, including their spatial distribution, time series trends, and correlations with other climate factors.\n\n**Key Findings:**\n\n1.  **Solar Radiation:** \n    *   The average daily solar radiation is approximately 200 W/m\u00b2.\n    *   The highest radiation value recorded was 376.30 W/m\u00b2 on June 14, 2020.\n    *   The lowest radiation value recorded was 5.37 W/m\u00b2 on December 21, 2019.\n\n2.  **Wind Speed:**\n    *   The average daily wind speed is approximately 2.3 m/s.\n    *   The highest wind speed recorded was 10.4 m/s on March 1, 2020.\n    *   The lowest wind speed recorded was 0.5 m/s on July 15, 2019.\n\n3.  **Relative Humidity:**\n    *   The average daily relative humidity is approximately 60%.\n    *   The highest relative humidity recorded was 96% on June 1, 2020.\n    *   The lowest relative humidity recorded was 20% on January 1, 2020.\n\n**Applications and Limitations:**\n\nThe NSRDB data can be used for various applications, including solar energy potential assessment, photovoltaic system design and optimization, solar resource forecasting, agricultural solar applications (solar drying, greenhouse operations), wind farm siting and energy production estimation, small-scale wind energy applications, agricultural applications (windbreaks, ventilation), hydrological modeling, and evapotranspiration calculations.\n\nHowever, there are some limitations to the analysis:\n\n*   The NSRDB data has a spatial resolution that may not capture fine-scale variations.\n*   The analysis is limited by the temporal range of the available data.\n*   Local terrain effects and microclimates may not be fully represented.\n*   Cloud cover and atmospheric conditions can affect data accuracy.\n*   PV performance estimates use standard assumptions and may differ from actual system performance.\n\n**Data Export:**\n\nThe complete dataset has been exported to CSV format. Access the data at: [nsrdb_stats.csv](nsrdb_stats.csv)\n\nOverall, this report provides valuable insights into the climate variables in the study area, which can be used for various applications related to solar and wind energy, agriculture, and hydrology.",

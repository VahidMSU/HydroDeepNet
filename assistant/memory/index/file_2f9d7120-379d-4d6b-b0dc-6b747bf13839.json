  "content": "This markdown file is a comprehensive soil report generated from the Gridded Soil Survey Geographic (gSSURGO) database. The report provides an overview of the soil characteristics, parameters, and limitations of a specific region in Michigan, USA.\n\n**Key Findings:**\n\n1. **Soil Texture:** The dominant soil texture is sand.\n2. **Soil Fertility:** The soils are moderately fertile, requiring standard amendments for good productivity.\n3. **pH Levels:** The pH levels are acidic, with 60.9% of the area having a pH below 5.5.\n4. **Rock Content:** The mean rock content is 4.4%, with no areas having high rock content (>15%).\n5. **Drainage:** The drainage is generally good, but there are some areas with poor drainage.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n\n1. Apply lime to increase soil pH for better nutrient availability.\n2. Apply fertilizers in smaller, more frequent doses to prevent nutrient leaching.\n\n**Correlations:**\n\nThe report also presents correlations between various soil parameters, including:\n\n* Bulk density and organic carbon have a strong negative relationship.\n* Clay content and silt content have a strong positive relationship.\n* Available water capacity is positively correlated with organic carbon and negatively correlated with sand content and bulk density.\n\n**Data Source and Methodology:**\n\nThe report is based on the gSSURGO database, which provides soil information at a 250m resolution. The analysis involves extracting soil data for the specified region, statistical analysis of soil parameters, soil texture classification, assessment of soil fertility and limitations, and generation of visualizations and spatial maps.\n\n**Limitations:**\n\nThe report notes some limitations, including:\n\n* The analysis is based on the resolution of the gSSURGO data (250m), which may not capture fine-scale soil variations.\n* Some parameters may have missing data in certain areas.\n* Local soil conditions may vary, and on-site testing is recommended for specific applications.\n\nOverall, this report provides a comprehensive overview of the soil characteristics and limitations of the specified region, along with recommendations for management practices to improve soil fertility and productivity.",

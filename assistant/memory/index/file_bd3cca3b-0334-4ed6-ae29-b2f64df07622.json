  "content": "The image presents a comprehensive spatial distribution of various environmental factors, including solar irradiance, wind speed, humidity, and relative humidity. The data is visualized through four distinct graphs, each representing a different aspect of these factors.\n\n* **Solar Irradiance**\n\t+ A color-coded graph displays the intensity of solar radiation across the region.\n\t+ Orange hues indicate higher levels of solar irradiance, while yellow and white represent lower intensities.\n\t+ The graph spans from -85.1 to -84.3 in latitude and -84.9 to -84.7 in longitude.\n* **Wind Speed**\n\t+ A blue-colored graph illustrates the wind speed distribution across the region.\n\t+ Darker shades of blue signify higher wind speeds, while lighter blues indicate lower speeds.\n\t+ The graph covers a similar range as the solar irradiance graph.\n* **Humidity**\n\t+ A purple-colored graph shows the humidity levels across the region.\n\t+ Denser purple hues represent higher humidity, while less dense purples indicate lower humidity.\n\t+ The graph spans from -85.1 to -84.3 in latitude and -84.9 to -84.7 in longitude.\n* **Relative Humidity**\n\t+ A magenta-colored graph displays the relative humidity distribution across the region.\n\t+ Denser magenta hues represent higher relative humidity, while less dense magentas indicate lower relative humidity.\n\t+ The graph covers a similar range as the humidity graph.\n\nIn summary, the image provides a detailed spatial analysis of solar irradiance, wind speed, humidity, and relative humidity across a specific geographic region. Each graph offers valuable insights into these environmental factors, allowing for a comprehensive understanding of the regional climate and weather patterns.",

  "content": "This is a detailed groundwater properties analysis report, likely generated by a geospatial modeling software (SWATGenXApp). The report provides an overview of the study area's hydrogeologic conditions, including spatial distribution maps and statistical summaries of various groundwater properties.\n\n**Key Findings:**\n\n1. **Water Table Depth:** Mean depth is 136.54 ft below surface, indicating deep groundwater conditions.\n2. **Aquifer Properties:** Upper aquifer has high hydraulic conductivity (338.86 ft/day) and transmissivity (28367.96 ft\u00b2/day), suggesting good potential for well yield.\n3. **Spatial Variability:** Water table depth shows high spatial variability (CV: 139.54%), indicating complex hydrogeologic conditions.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n\n1. **Well Development:** Target the upper aquifer at depths of 141.5-218.9 m, which has good hydraulic properties.\n2. **Groundwater Management:** Establish monitoring wells to track long-term water level trends and develop sustainable extraction limits based on aquifer properties.\n3. **Further Investigations:** Conduct aquifer tests, analyze groundwater quality, and develop numerical groundwater flow models.\n\n**Data Source and Methodology:**\n\nThe analysis is based on Empirical Bayesian Kriging (EBK) interpolation of groundwater properties from a HDF5 database. The report highlights the limitations of the analysis, including the use of interpolated data instead of direct measurements and potential high kriging uncertainty in areas with sparse well data.\n\n**Data Export:**\n\nA complete dataset has been exported to CSV format, available at [groundwater_stats.csv](groundwater_stats.csv).\n\nOverall, this report provides a comprehensive understanding of the study area's groundwater properties and hydrogeologic conditions, highlighting opportunities for sustainable groundwater management and further research.",

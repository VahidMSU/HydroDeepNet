  "content": "This markdown file appears to be a soil analysis report generated from the Gridded Soil Survey Geographic (gSSURGO) database. The report provides an overview of the soil characteristics, fertility level, and limitations for a specific region.\n\n**Key Findings**\n\n* Dominant soil texture is Sand\n* Soil fertility level is Moderate\n* Soil pH is acidic (4.82), which may require liming\n* Organic Carbon content is high (6.61%), indicating good soil structure and water retention\n* Available Water Capacity is moderate (0.122 cm/cm)\n* Hydraulic Conductivity is relatively high (235.353 mm/hr)\n\n**Soil Limitations**\n\n* Soil depth limitations: shallow soil (<50cm) affects 0% of the area, but raised beds or shallow-rooted crops may be recommended in affected areas\n* Rock content limitations: high rock content (>15%) affects 0% of the area, but rock removal or selecting tolerant crops may be recommended\n* Drainage limitations: poor drainage affects 0.1% of the area, but drainage systems or water-tolerant crops may be recommended\n* pH limitations: acidic soils (pH<5.5) affect 60.9% of the area, and liming may be required\n\n**Recommendations**\n\n* Apply lime to increase soil pH for better nutrient availability\n* Apply fertilizers in smaller, more frequent doses to prevent nutrient leaching\n\n**Data Source and Methodology**\n\nThe report is based on the gSSURGO database, which provides soil information at a 250m resolution. The data was extracted, statistically analyzed, and visualized using various methods.\n\nOverall, this report provides valuable insights into the soil characteristics and limitations of the specified region, which can inform agricultural practices, land use planning, and environmental management decisions.",

  "content": "This markdown file is a soil analysis report generated from the Gridded Soil Survey Geographic (gSSURGO) database. Here's a summary of the report:\n\n**Region and Parameters**\n\nThe report covers an area in Michigan, USA with coordinates [44.0315, 44.6131] to [-85.1355, -84.2785]. The report analyzes various soil parameters such as albedo, available water capacity, bulk density, calcium carbonate, organic carbon, clay content, depth, electrical conductivity, pH, rock fragment content, sand content, silt content, and hydraulic conductivity.\n\n**Soil Characteristics Summary**\n\nThe dominant soil texture is sand, with a moderate fertility level. The soil description suggests that it requires standard amendments for good productivity.\n\n**Soil Fertility Components**\n\nA table shows the values of various soil parameters, along with their ratings and implications. The key takeaways are:\n\n* pH: acidic (4.82), may require liming\n* Organic Carbon: high (6.61%), indicating high fertility\n* Available Water Capacity: moderate (0.122 cm/cm)\n* Soil Texture: sand, affects drainage and nutrient retention\n\n**Soil Parameter Statistics**\n\nA table presents key statistics for the analyzed soil parameters, including mean, median, minimum, maximum, standard deviation, and coefficient of variation.\n\n**Limitations and Recommendations**\n\nThe report identifies several limitations:\n\n* Mean soil depth: 1911.5 cm\n* Areas with shallow soil (<50cm): 0%\n* Limitation level: slight\n* Recommendation: choose shallow-rooted crops or implement raised beds\n\nOther limitations include:\n\n* pH: severe limitation (60.9% of area has acidic soils)\n* Salinity: slight limitation (mean electrical conductivity: 0.08 dS/m)\n\n**Soil Management Recommendations**\n\nThe report recommends applying lime to increase soil pH for better nutrient availability and applying fertilizers in smaller, more frequent doses to prevent nutrient leaching.\n\n**Parameter Correlations**\n\nA correlation matrix shows relationships between various soil parameters, including strong positive correlations between clay content and silt content, and strong negative correlations between bulk density and organic carbon.\n\n**Data Source and Methodology**\n\nThe report is based on the gSSURGO database, which provides soil information at a 250m resolution. The analysis involves extraction of soil data for the specified region, statistical analysis of soil parameters, and generation of visualizations and spatial maps.\n\nOverall, this report provides a comprehensive analysis of the soil conditions in the specified region, highlighting potential limitations and recommending management practices to address them.",

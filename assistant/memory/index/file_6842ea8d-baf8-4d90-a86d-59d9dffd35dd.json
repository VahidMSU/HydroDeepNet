  "content": "This markdown file appears to be a soil report generated by the SWATGenXApp using data from the Gridded Soil Survey Geographic (gSSURGO) database. Here's a summary of the report:\n\n**Overview**\n\nThe report covers an area with coordinates [44.0315, 44.6131] longitude and [-85.1355, -84.2785] latitude. The available soil parameters include various physical and chemical properties.\n\n**Soil Characteristics Summary**\n\n* Dominant soil texture: Sand\n* Soil fertility level: Moderate\n* Description: Moderately fertile soils requiring standard amendments for good productivity\n\n**Soil Fertility Components**\n\nThe report provides a table summarizing the values of different soil fertility components, including pH, organic carbon, available water capacity, and others. The values are rated as Low, Moderate, or High.\n\n**Soil Parameter Statistics**\n\nThe report presents key statistics for various soil parameters, including mean, median, minimum, maximum, standard deviation, and coefficient of variation (CV).\n\n**Spatial Distribution Maps**\n\nThe report includes maps showing the spatial distribution of key soil parameters across the study area.\n\n**Soil Limitations**\n\nThe report identifies several limitations in the study area, including:\n\n* Shallow soil depth\n* High rock content\n* Poor drainage\n* Acidic soils\n* Salinity\n\n**Soil Management Recommendations**\n\nBased on the analysis, the following management practices are recommended:\n\n1. Apply lime to increase soil pH for better nutrient availability.\n2. Apply fertilizers in smaller, more frequent doses to prevent nutrient leaching.\n\n**Parameter Correlations**\n\nThe report presents a correlation matrix showing relationships between different soil parameters.\n\n**Data Source and Methodology**\n\nThe report is based on the gSSURGO database, which provides soil information at a 250m resolution. The analysis includes extraction of soil data for the specified region, statistical analysis of soil parameters, and assessment of soil fertility and limitations.\n\nOverall, this report provides a comprehensive analysis of soil properties and limitations in the study area, along with recommendations for management practices to improve soil health and productivity.",

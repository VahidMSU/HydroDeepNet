  "content": "This is a soil analysis report generated by the gSSURGO (Gridded Soil Survey Geographic) database. The report provides an overview of the soil characteristics, fertility level, and limitations for a specific region.\n\n**Key Findings:**\n\n* Dominant soil texture is sand\n* Soil fertility level is moderate, requiring standard amendments for good productivity\n* pH levels are acidic, which may require liming to adjust pH\n* Organic carbon content is high, indicating good soil structure and water retention\n* Available water capacity is moderate, indicating average irrigation needs\n\n**Soil Limitations:**\n\n* Areas with shallow soil (<50cm) account for 0.0% of the region\n* Rock content limitations are slight, but may require rock removal or selecting crops tolerant of rocky soils\n* Drainage limitations are slight, but may require drainage systems or selecting water-tolerant crops in poorly drained areas\n* pH limitations are severe, with 60.9% of the area having acidic soils (pH<5.5)\n* Salinity limitations are slight, with no areas having high salinity (>4 dS/m)\n\n**Recommendations:**\n\n* Apply lime to increase soil pH for better nutrient availability\n* Apply fertilizers in smaller, more frequent doses to prevent nutrient leaching\n\n**Data Source and Methodology:**\n\nThe report is based on the gSSURGO database, which provides soil information at a 250m resolution. The analysis includes statistical analysis of soil parameters, soil texture classification, assessment of soil fertility and limitations, and generation of visualizations and spatial maps.\n\n**Limitations:**\n\n* The analysis may not capture fine-scale soil variations due to the resolution of the gSSURGO data (250m)\n* Some parameters may have missing data in certain areas\n* Local soil conditions may vary and on-site testing is recommended for specific applications.",

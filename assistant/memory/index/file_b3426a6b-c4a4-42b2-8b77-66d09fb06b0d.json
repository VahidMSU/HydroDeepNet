  "content": "This is a comprehensive report on solar radiation and related climate variables, based on the National Solar Radiation Database (NSRDB). The report provides an in-depth analysis of various aspects of solar radiation, including its spatial distribution, temporal variability, and correlations with other climate variables. Here are some key points from the report:\n\n**Solar Radiation Analysis**\n\n* The NSRDB data shows that the study area has a moderate solar potential, with average daily global horizontal irradiance (GHI) ranging from 150 to 250 W/m\u00b2.\n* The highest radiation values occur in June and July, while the lowest values are recorded during winter months.\n* Extreme high days per year: 18.3\n* Extreme low days per year: 18.3\n\n**Climate Variable Correlations**\n\n* Solar radiation vs. humidity: -0.55\n* Solar radiation vs. wind speed: -0.42\n* Solar aridity index: 2.01\n\n**PV Performance Modeling**\n\n* The report uses a standard PV performance model to estimate the energy production of a typical solar panel.\n* The results show that the study area has a relatively low solar irradiance, which may affect the efficiency of solar panels.\n\n**Spatial Distribution and Time Series Analysis**\n\n* The spatial maps show the distribution of climate variables across the study area.\n* The time series analysis shows the change in climate variables over the entire period.\n\n**Applications**\n\n* Solar energy potential assessment\n* Photovoltaic system design and optimization\n* Solar resource forecasting\n* Agricultural solar applications (solar drying, greenhouse operations)\n* Wind farm siting and energy production estimation\n\n**Limitations**\n\n* The NSRDB data has a spatial resolution that may not capture fine-scale variations.\n* The analysis is limited by the temporal range of the available data.\n* Local terrain effects and microclimates may not be fully represented.\n\nOverall, this report provides valuable insights into solar radiation patterns in the study area, which can inform decisions related to solar energy development, agricultural practices, and other applications. However, it's essential to consider the limitations of the data and analysis when interpreting the results.",

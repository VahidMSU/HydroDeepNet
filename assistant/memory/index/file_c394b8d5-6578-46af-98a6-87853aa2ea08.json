  "content": "This is a groundwater properties analysis report, generated on April 12, 2025. The report provides an overview of the groundwater properties in a specific region, including:\n\n1. **Region**: The study area covers a latitude range of [44.0315, 44.6131] and longitude range of [-85.1355, -84.2785].\n2. **Available Variables**: The analysis includes eight variables:\n\t* Upper Aquifer Thickness (AQ_THK_1)\n\t* Lower Aquifer Thickness (AQ_THK_2)\n\t* Hydraulic Conductivity (H_COND_1 and H_COND_2)\n\t* Transmissivity (TRANSMSV_1 and TRANSMSV_2)\n\t* Static Water Level (SWL)\n3. **Summary Statistics**: The report provides summary statistics for each variable, including mean, median, standard deviation, and coefficient of variation.\n4. **Spatial Distribution**: Maps are provided to show the spatial distribution of groundwater properties across the study area.\n5. **Estimation Uncertainty**: Maps are also provided to show the standard error of the kriging estimates, indicating the level of confidence in the data.\n6. **Statistical Distributions**: Histograms are included to show the frequency distribution of each parameter.\n7. **Property Correlations**: A heatmap is provided to show the Pearson correlation coefficients between different groundwater properties.\n8. **Hydrogeologic Implications**: The report discusses the implications of the analysis for hydrogeology, including:\n\t* Water table depth and its implications\n\t* Hydraulic conductivity and transmissivity values and their implications\n\t* Recommendations for well development, groundwater management, and further investigations\n\n**Recommendations:**\n\n1. Target depth for well development in the upper aquifer: 141.5 - 218.9 m\n2. Establish monitoring wells to track long-term water level trends\n3. Develop sustainable extraction limits based on aquifer properties\n4. Conduct aquifer tests to verify estimated hydraulic properties\n5. Analyze groundwater quality to assess suitability for intended uses\n\n**Limitations:**\n\n1. The analysis is based on interpolated data rather than direct measurements\n2. Kriging uncertainty may be high in areas with sparse well data\n3. Local heterogeneity may not be captured at the analysis resolution\n4. Temporal variations in water levels are not addressed",

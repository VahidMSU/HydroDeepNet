  "content": "This is a comprehensive report analyzing land use patterns and trends using the USDA National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) Cropland Data Layer (CDL). The report covers various aspects of agricultural diversity, crop rotation, non-agricultural land cover changes, and provides management recommendations based on the observed data.\n\n**Key Findings:**\n\n1. **Increasing row crop production**: Corn and soybean acreage have increased, indicating a focus on commodity crops.\n2. **Declining wheat production**: Wheat acreage has decreased, which may be due to shifting market conditions or climate factors.\n3. **Increasing crop diversity**: There is an expansion in the variety of crops grown, contributing to reduced pest pressure and improved soil health.\n4. **Wetland expansion**: Changes in wetland areas affect water quality, flood control, and biodiversity.\n\n**Management Recommendations:**\n\n1. **Diversified crop rotations**\n2. **Cover crops**\n3. **Conservation practices** (precision agriculture, conservation tillage, buffer strips)\n4. **Integrated pest management**\n5. **Natural area conservation** (protect forests and wetlands)\n6. **Habitat corridors** (establish or maintain corridors between natural areas)\n\n**Data Source and Methodology:**\n\n1. The report is based on the USDA NASS Cropland Data Layer (CDL) at 30-meter resolution.\n2. CDL data extraction, separation of agricultural crops from non-agricultural land cover types, aggregation, calculation, analysis, visualization.\n\n**Limitations:**\n\n1. **Accuracy**: CDL accuracy varies by crop type and region (typically 85-95% for major crops).\n2. **Data limitations**: Analysis is limited to the temporal range of available data.\n3. **Local factors**: Local factors affecting land use decisions are not captured.\n\n**Exported Data:**\n\nThe complete dataset has been exported to CSV format, accessible at [cdl_data.csv](cdl_data.csv).\n\nOverall, this report provides valuable insights into agricultural and non-agricultural land use patterns in the region, highlighting areas for improvement and recommending management practices that can enhance ecosystem services and promote sustainable agriculture.",

  "content": "This markdown file appears to be a soil analysis report generated from the Gridded Soil Survey Geographic (gSSURGO) database. The report provides an overview of the soil characteristics, fertility level, and limitations of a specific region in Michigan.\n\n**Key Findings:**\n\n1. **Soil Texture:** Dominant texture is sand.\n2. **Fertility Level:** Moderate\n3. **pH:** Acidic (4.82)\n4. **Organic Carbon:** High (6.61%)\n5. **Available Water Capacity:** Moderate (0.122 cm/cm)\n\n**Limitations:**\n\n1. **Soil Depth:** Mean soil depth is 1911.5 cm, but areas with shallow soil (<50cm) are minimal.\n2. **Rock Content:** Mean rock content is 4.4%, but areas with high rock content (>15%) are rare.\n3. **pH:** Areas with acidic soils (pH<5.5) cover 60.9% of the region.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n\n1. Apply lime to increase soil pH for better nutrient availability.\n2. Apply fertilizers in smaller, more frequent doses to prevent nutrient leaching.\n\n**Correlations:**\n\nThe report also presents a correlation matrix showing relationships between various soil parameters. Strong positive correlations appear in red, while strong negative correlations appear in blue.\n\n**Data Source and Methodology:**\n\nThe report is based on the gSSURGO database, which provides soil information at a 250m resolution. The analysis involves extracting soil data for the specified region, performing statistical analysis of soil parameters, classifying soil texture, assessing soil fertility and limitations, and generating visualizations and spatial maps.\n\n**Limitations:**\n\nThe report acknowledges that the analysis is based on a coarse resolution (250m) and may not capture fine-scale soil variations. Additionally, some parameters may have missing data in certain areas, and local soil conditions may vary.\n\nOverall, this report provides valuable insights into the soil characteristics and limitations of a specific region, which can inform agricultural practices, land use planning, and environmental management decisions.",

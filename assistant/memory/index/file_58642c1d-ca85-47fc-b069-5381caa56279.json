  "content": "This is a soil analysis report generated by the SWATGenXApp using data from the Gridded Soil Survey Geographic (gSSURGO) database. The report provides an overview of the soil characteristics, fertility level, and limitations of a specific region.\n\n**Key Findings:**\n\n* The dominant soil texture in the region is sand.\n* The soil fertility level is moderate, with some areas having acidic or alkaline soils that may require lime application to adjust pH.\n* The available water capacity is moderate, indicating average irrigation needs.\n* The soil has good drainage and low rock fragment content.\n\n**Soil Limitations:**\n\n* Shallow soil depth (<50cm) in 0.0% of the area, with a slight limitation level.\n* High rock content (>15%) in 0.0% of the area, with a slight limitation level.\n* Poor drainage in 0.1% of the area, with a slight limitation level.\n* Acidic soils (pH<5.5) in 60.9% of the area, with a severe limitation level.\n\n**Soil Management Recommendations:**\n\n* Apply lime to increase soil pH for better nutrient availability.\n* Apply fertilizers in smaller, more frequent doses to prevent nutrient leaching.\n\n**Parameter Correlations:**\n\n* Strong negative correlation between bulk density and organic carbon.\n* Strong positive correlation between clay content and silt content.\n\n**Data Source and Methodology:**\n\n* The report is based on the gSSURGO database, which provides soil information at a 250m resolution.\n* Statistical analysis of soil parameters was performed using SWATGenXApp.\n\n**Limitations:**\n\n* The analysis may not capture fine-scale soil variations due to the resolution of the gSSURGO data (250m).\n* Some parameters may have missing data in certain areas.\n* Local soil conditions may vary and on-site testing is recommended for specific applications.",

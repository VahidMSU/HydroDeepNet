  "content": "This is a comprehensive report on climate and solar radiation analysis, using data from the National Solar Radiation Database (NSRDB). The report covers various aspects of solar radiation, wind energy, agricultural applications, hydrological modeling, and more.\n\nHere's a summary of the key findings:\n\n1. **Solar Radiation Analysis:**\n\t* Average daily global horizontal irradiance (GHI) is around 175 W/m\u00b2.\n\t* Highest radiation days occur in June with an average value of 306.4 W/m\u00b2.\n\t* Extreme high and low radiation days are relatively evenly distributed throughout the year, with approximately 18.3 events per year.\n2. **Wind Energy Analysis:**\n\t* Average wind speed is around 5.8 m/s, with a maximum recorded value of 23.9 m/s.\n\t* Wind speeds tend to be higher in winter months and lower in summer months.\n3. **Agricultural Applications:**\n\t* Solar radiation data can inform agricultural decisions related to crop growth modeling, evapotranspiration calculations, and irrigation scheduling.\n4. **Hydrological Modeling:**\n\t* NSRDB data can improve hydrological models like SWAT+ by incorporating accurate solar radiation estimates for energy balance calculations and snow accumulation/melt modeling.\n5. **Climate Variable Correlations:**\n\t* Solar radiation shows a moderate negative correlation with relative humidity (-0.55) and wind speed (-0.42).\n6. **Time Series Analysis:**\n\t* The time series analysis reveals trends in climate variables over the study period, but no significant long-term changes are observed.\n7. **Spatial Distribution:**\n\t* Spatial maps show the distribution of climate variables across the study area, with areas receiving higher solar radiation values generally having lower wind speeds.\n\n**Limitations and Recommendations:**\n\n1. **Data Resolution:** The NSRDB data has a spatial resolution that may not capture fine-scale variations.\n2. **Temporal Range:** The analysis is limited by the temporal range of the available data (2010-2020).\n3. **Terrain Effects:** Local terrain effects and microclimates may not be fully represented in the analysis.\n\n**Data Export:**\n\nThe complete dataset has been exported to CSV format, accessible at [nsrdb_stats.csv](nsrdb_stats.csv).\n\nOverall, this report provides valuable insights into climate and solar radiation patterns for a given region. The findings can inform decisions related to renewable energy development, agricultural planning, hydrological modeling, and more.",

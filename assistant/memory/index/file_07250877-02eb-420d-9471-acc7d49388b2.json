  "content": "This markdown file appears to be a soil analysis report generated by the SWATGenXApp tool. The report provides an overview of the soil characteristics and properties for a specific region, which is defined by latitude and longitude boundaries.\n\n**Key Findings**\n\n* The dominant soil texture in the region is sand.\n* The soil fertility level is moderate, requiring standard amendments for good productivity.\n* The pH level is acidic (4.82), which may require liming to adjust the pH.\n* The available water capacity is moderate (0.122 cm/cm).\n* The hydraulic conductivity is high (235.353 mm/hr).\n\n**Soil Parameter Statistics**\n\nThe report provides a summary of key soil parameters, including mean, median, minimum, maximum, standard deviation, and coefficient of variation.\n\n**Spatial Distribution Maps**\n\nThe report includes spatial distribution maps for key soil parameters, which can be found in the 'parameter_maps' folder.\n\n**Soil Limitations**\n\nThe report identifies several soil limitations, including:\n\n* Shallow soil (<50cm) in 0.0% of the area\n* High rock content (>15%) in 0.0% of the area\n* Poor drainage in 0.1% of the area\n* Acidic soils (pH<5.5) in 60.9% of the area\n* Salinity limitations in 0.0% of the area\n\n**Soil Management Recommendations**\n\nBased on the analysis, the report recommends:\n\n1. Applying lime to increase soil pH for better nutrient availability.\n2. Applying fertilizers in smaller, more frequent doses to prevent nutrient leaching.\n\n**Data Source and Methodology**\n\nThe report is based on the Gridded Soil Survey Geographic (gSSURGO) database, which provides soil information at a 250m resolution. The gSSURGO database combines data from soil surveys conducted by the USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS).\n\nOverall, this report provides a comprehensive analysis of the soil characteristics and properties for a specific region, including spatial distribution maps and recommendations for soil management.",

  "content": "This report is a comprehensive analysis of climate variables, including solar radiation and wind speed, for a specific region over an extended period. The analysis utilizes the National Solar Radiation Database (NSRDB) data, which provides high-resolution estimates of various environmental parameters.\n\n**Summary of Key Findings:**\n\n1.  **Solar Radiation:** The analysis reveals moderate to high solar potential in the study area, with an average daily global horizontal irradiance (GHI) of around 220 W/m\u00b2.\n2.  **Wind Speed:** Wind speed is relatively low, averaging around 4-5 m/s, which may limit the feasibility of wind energy applications.\n3.  **Relative Humidity and Temperature:** The relative humidity averages around 60%, while temperature ranges from -10\u00b0C to 30\u00b0C, indicating a temperate climate with moderate seasonal variations.\n4.  **Climate Variable Correlations:** Significant correlations are found between solar radiation and humidity (-0.55) and wind speed (-0.42).\n5.  **Extreme Events:** The analysis identifies 24 heat wave events per year, each lasting approximately 4 days on average.\n\n**Applications:**\n\n1.  **Solar Energy Applications:** The study area has suitable conditions for solar energy production, with potential applications including photovoltaic systems and solar drying technologies.\n2.  **Wind Energy Applications:** While wind speeds are relatively low, they may still be sufficient for small-scale wind energy installations or agricultural uses like windbreaks and ventilation.\n3.  **Agricultural Applications:** The data can inform decisions related to crop growth modeling, evapotranspiration calculations, and irrigation scheduling.\n4.  **Hydrological Modeling Applications:** The analysis provides valuable insights into solar radiation and wind patterns for use in hydrological models like SWAT+.\n\n**Limitations:**\n\n1.  **Spatial Resolution:** The NSRDB data may not capture fine-scale variations due to its spatial resolution.\n2.  **Temporal Range:** The analysis is limited by the availability of data, which may not cover the entire period of interest.\n3.  **Local Terrain Effects:** Microclimates and terrain effects might not be fully represented in the dataset.\n\n**Data Export:**\n\nThe complete dataset has been exported to CSV format for further use or analysis.",

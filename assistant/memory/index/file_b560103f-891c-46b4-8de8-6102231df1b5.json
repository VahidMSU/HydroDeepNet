  "content": "This appears to be a comprehensive report on solar radiation and wind energy assessment for a specific region, using data from the National Solar Radiation Database (NSRDB). Here's an analysis of the content:\n\n**Key Findings**\n\n1. **Solar Radiation**: The report highlights moderate solar potential in the study area, with average daily global horizontal irradiance (GHI) ranging from 150 to 250 W/m\u00b2.\n2. **Wind Speed**: Wind speed data shows a moderate wind resource, with an average annual wind speed of around 4-5 m/s.\n3. **Climate Correlations**: Analysis reveals strong negative correlations between solar radiation and relative humidity (-0.55), as well as between solar radiation and wind speed (-0.42).\n4. **Extreme Events**: The report identifies extreme high and low solar radiation days, with the highest recorded value being 376.30 W/m\u00b2.\n\n**Applications**\n\n1. **Solar Energy Applications**: The report suggests that solar installations are feasible in the study area, but with lower yields compared to sunnier regions.\n2. **Wind Energy Applications**: Wind speed data can be used for wind farm siting and energy production estimation.\n3. **Agricultural Applications**: NSRDB data can inform agricultural decisions related to evapotranspiration modeling, crop growth modeling, and irrigation scheduling.\n\n**Methodology**\n\n1. **Data Source**: The report uses the National Solar Radiation Database (NSRDB) as its primary data source.\n2. **Processing Steps**: Raw data is extracted from HDF5 database, scaled correctly, spatially subset to the region of interest, temporally aggregated, and analyzed using statistical methods.\n\n**Limitations**\n\n1. **Spatial Resolution**: The NSRDB data has a spatial resolution that may not capture fine-scale variations.\n2. **Temporal Range**: The analysis is limited by the temporal range of the available data.\n3. **Local Terrain Effects**: Local terrain effects and microclimates may not be fully represented.\n\n**Export**\n\nThe complete dataset has been exported to CSV format, which can be accessed at [nsrdb_stats.csv](nsrdb_stats.csv).\n\nOverall, this report provides valuable insights into solar radiation and wind energy resources in the study area. However, it is essential to consider the limitations of the data and methodology when interpreting the results.\n\nIf you have any specific questions or would like me to elaborate on any aspect of the report, please feel free to ask!",

  "content": "This markdown file contains a comprehensive soil analysis report generated by the SWATGenXApp. The report provides an overview of the soil characteristics, fertility level, and limitations of a specific region in Michigan, USA.\n\n**Key Findings**\n\n* The dominant soil texture is sand.\n* The soil fertility level is moderate, requiring standard amendments for good productivity.\n* pH levels are acidic (4.82), which may require liming to improve nutrient availability.\n* Organic carbon content is high (6.61%), indicating good soil structure and water retention.\n* Available water capacity is moderate (0.122 cm/cm), suggesting average irrigation needs.\n\n**Soil Limitations**\n\n* Soil depth limitations: shallow soil (<50cm) in 0% of the area, with a slight limitation level.\n* Rock content limitations: high rock content (>15%) in 0% of the area, with a slight limitation level.\n* Drainage limitations: poor drainage in 0.1% of the area, with a slight limitation level.\n* pH limitations: acidic soils (pH<5.5) in 60.9% of the area, with a severe limitation level.\n\n**Recommendations**\n\n* Apply lime to increase soil pH for better nutrient availability.\n* Apply fertilizers in smaller, more frequent doses to prevent nutrient leaching.\n\n**Data and Methodology**\n\nThe report is based on the Gridded Soil Survey Geographic (gSSURGO) database, which provides soil information at a 250m resolution. The analysis includes statistical analysis of soil parameters, soil texture classification, and assessment of soil fertility and limitations.\n\n**Limitations**\n\n* The analysis is based on the resolution of the gSSURGO data (250m), which may not capture fine-scale soil variations.\n* Some parameters may have missing data in certain areas.\n* Local soil conditions may vary and on-site testing is recommended for specific applications.",

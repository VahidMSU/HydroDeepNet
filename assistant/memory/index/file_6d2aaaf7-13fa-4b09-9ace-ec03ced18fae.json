  "content": "The image presents a comprehensive spatial distribution of various environmental factors, including solar irradiance, wind speed, humidity, and relative humidity. The data is displayed using color-coded heat maps, with each factor represented by a distinct color scale.\n\n*   **Solar Irradiance**\n    *   Color Scale: Red (high) to Yellow (low)\n    *   Range: Not specified\n    *   Description: The solar irradiance map shows the amount of solar radiation received at different locations. The red color indicates areas with high solar irradiance, while yellow represents areas with low solar irradiance.\n*   **Wind Speed**\n    *   Color Scale: Dark Blue (high) to Light Blue (low)\n    *   Range: Not specified\n    *   Description: The wind speed map displays the velocity of winds at different locations. The dark blue color indicates areas with high wind speeds, while light blue represents areas with low wind speeds.\n*   **Humidity**\n    *   Color Scale: Purple (high) to Pink (low)\n    *   Range: Not specified\n    *   Description: The humidity map shows the level of moisture in the air at different locations. The purple color indicates areas with high humidity, while pink represents areas with low humidity.\n*   **Relative Humidity**\n    *   Color Scale: Magenta (high) to White (low)\n    *   Range: Not specified\n    *   Description: The relative humidity map displays the percentage of moisture in the air compared to the maximum amount it can hold at a given temperature. The magenta color indicates areas with high relative humidity, while white represents areas with low relative humidity.\n\nIn summary, the image provides a visual representation of the spatial distribution of solar irradiance, wind speed, humidity, and relative humidity across different locations. Each factor is represented by a distinct color scale, allowing for easy comparison and analysis of the data.",

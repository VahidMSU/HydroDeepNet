  "content": "This is a soil report generated by the SWATGenXApp using data from the Gridded Soil Survey Geographic (gSSURGO) database. The report provides an overview of the soil characteristics and fertility level in a specific region.\n\n**Key Findings:**\n\n1. **Soil Texture:** Dominant texture is Sand, with moderate to high sand content.\n2. **Fertility Level:** Moderate fertility, requiring standard amendments for good productivity.\n3. **pH:** Acidic soils (pH < 5.5) cover approximately 60.9% of the area, indicating a need for liming.\n4. **Organic Carbon:** High organic carbon content indicates high fertility and good soil structure.\n5. **Available Water Capacity:** Moderate water retention capacity.\n\n**Limitations:**\n\n1. Shallow soil (<50cm) in some areas\n2. High rock content (>15%) in some areas\n3. Poor drainage in 0.1% of the area\n4. Acidic soils (pH < 5.5) cover approximately 60.9% of the area\n\n**Recommendations:**\n\n1. Apply lime to increase soil pH for better nutrient availability.\n2. Apply fertilizers in smaller, more frequent doses to prevent nutrient leaching.\n\n**Correlation Matrix:** The report includes a correlation matrix showing relationships between soil parameters, including strong positive and negative correlations.\n\n**Data Source and Methodology:** The report is based on the gSSURGO database, which provides soil information at a 250m resolution. The analysis involves extraction of soil data, statistical analysis, soil texture classification, assessment of soil fertility and limitations, and generation of visualizations and spatial maps.\n\nOverall, this report provides valuable insights into the soil characteristics and fertility level in the specified region, highlighting areas that require attention and providing recommendations for management practices to improve soil health.",

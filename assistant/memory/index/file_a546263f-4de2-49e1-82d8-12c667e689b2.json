  "content": "This markdown file appears to be a soil analysis report generated by the SWATGenXApp tool. The report provides an overview of the soil characteristics, limitations, and management recommendations for a specific region.\n\n**Key Findings:**\n\n1. **Dominant Soil Texture:** Sand\n2. **Soil Fertility Level:** Moderate\n3. **pH Level:** Acidic (4.82)\n4. **Organic Carbon Content:** High (6.61%)\n5. **Available Water Capacity:** Moderate (0.122 cm/cm)\n\n**Limitations:**\n\n1. **Soil Depth Limitations:** Slight, with areas of shallow soil (<50cm) at 0.0%\n2. **Rock Content Limitations:** Slight, with areas of high rock content (>15%) at 0.0%\n3. **pH Limitations:** Severe, with areas of acidic soils (pH<5.5) at 60.9%\n4. **Salinity Limitations:** Slight, with mean electrical conductivity at 0.08 dS/m\n\n**Management Recommendations:**\n\n1. Apply lime to increase soil pH for better nutrient availability\n2. Apply fertilizers in smaller, more frequent doses to prevent nutrient leaching\n\n**Data Export:**\n\nThe complete dataset has been exported to CSV format for further analysis.\n\n**Methodology and Limitations:**\n\nThe report is based on the Gridded Soil Survey Geographic (gSSURGO) database, which provides soil information at a 250m resolution. The analysis includes statistical analysis of soil parameters, soil texture classification, assessment of soil fertility and limitations, and generation of visualizations and spatial maps. However, there are some limitations to consider, such as the resolution of the gSSURGO data (250m) and potential missing data in certain areas.\n\nOverall, this report provides a comprehensive overview of the soil characteristics and limitations for a specific region, along with management recommendations to improve soil health and productivity.",

  "content": "This is a PRISM (Parameter-elevation Regressions on Independent Slopes Model) climate data analysis report for a region with latitude from 44.0315 to 44.6131 and longitude from -85.1355 to -84.2785. The report covers the period from 2015 to 2020, analyzing precipitation, temperature, and other climate variables.\n\n**Key Findings:**\n\n* Significant warming trend: all temperature metrics show a significant increase over the analyzed period.\n* Increasing precipitation: with an average annual increase of +20.083 mm/yr, resulting in a total change of +100.42 mm (1288.0%).\n* Seasonal patterns:\n\t+ Temperature extremes typically occur in July and January.\n\t+ Precipitation is highest in October and lowest in January.\n* Time series analysis indicates significant trends for all variables.\n\n**Implications:**\n\n* Climate warming may impact growing season length, crop selection options, evapotranspiration rates, heat stress on crops, and pest and disease prevalence.\n* Increased precipitation may lead to higher soil moisture availability, potential increases in flooding and erosion risk, changes in nutrient leaching and water quality, and potential delays in field operations.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n\n* Agricultural applications:\n\t+ Choose crop varieties adapted to local temperature and precipitation patterns.\n\t+ Schedule planting based on seasonal temperature and precipitation trends.\n\t+ Design irrigation systems and scheduling based on climate patterns.\n* Hydrological applications:\n\t+ Use precipitation patterns to inform water allocation decisions.\n\t+ Consider precipitation intensity and seasonality for flood risk assessment.\n\n**Data Source and Methodology:**\n\nThe analysis is based on PRISM climate data, with processing steps including extraction, spatial subsetting, temporal aggregation, statistical analysis, and visualization. The report notes limitations due to the temporal range and resolution of the available data, spatial interpolation uncertainties, and potential differences between historical trends and future climate conditions.\n\n**Data Export:**\n\nThe complete dataset is exported in CSV format at [prism_stats.csv](prism_stats.csv).",

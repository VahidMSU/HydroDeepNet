It encompasses categories such as forests, wetlands, developed areas, water bodies, and both agricultural crops (e.g., corn, soybeans, wheat) and non-agricultural land cover types. Metrics for measuring agricultural intensity are provided, including the Agricultural Intensity Index, Row Crop Percentage, Small Grains Percentage, Perennial Cover Percentage, Specialty Crops Percentage, and crop diversity measures. The dataset also offers insights into spatial patterns and trends over time through various visualization tools and statistical analysis.",

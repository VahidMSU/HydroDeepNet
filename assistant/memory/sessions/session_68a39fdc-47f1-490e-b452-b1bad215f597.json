Key statistics include balanced anomaly distributions across products, strong seasonal variability in NDVI with peak values in November and minimum values in January, and varying spatial means and standard deviations across products. Spatial coverage ranges from 49.8% to 100.0%. Additionally, product comparison via z-scores and correlation analysis reveal relationships between products.",

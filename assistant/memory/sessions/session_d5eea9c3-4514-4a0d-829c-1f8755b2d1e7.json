      "query_analysis": "Here's an improved version of the response:\n\n**Description of Image: nsrdb_spatial.png**\n\nThe image displays a comprehensive spatial distribution of four key environmental factors: solar irradiance, wind speed, humidity, and relative humidity. The data is presented using color-coded heat maps, with each factor represented by a distinct color scale.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the color scales used for each factor:\n\n*   **Solar Irradiance**: Red (high) to Yellow (low)\n    *   Description: This map shows the amount of solar radiation received at different locations. High irradiance areas are indicated in red, while low irradiance areas are represented by yellow.\n*   **Wind Speed**: Dark Blue (high) to Light Blue (low)\n    *   Description: The wind speed map displays the velocity of winds at different locations. Areas with high wind speeds are shown in dark blue, while those with low wind speeds are represented by light blue.\n*   **Humidity**: Purple (high) to Pink (low)\n    *   Description: This map shows the level of moisture in the air at different locations. High humidity areas are indicated in purple, while low humidity areas are represented by pink.\n*   **Relative Humidity**: Magenta (high) to White (low)\n    *   Description: The relative humidity map displays the percentage of moisture in the air compared to the maximum amount it can hold at a given temperature. Areas with high relative humidity are shown in magenta, while those with low relative humidity are represented by white.\n\n**Summary**\n\nThe image provides an intuitive visual representation of the spatial distribution of solar irradiance, wind speed, humidity, and relative humidity across different locations. The distinct color scales for each factor facilitate easy comparison and analysis of the data, allowing users to gain insights into the environmental conditions depicted in the image.\n\nI made some changes to improve clarity and readability:\n\n1.  I added a clear title to the response.\n2.  I used bullet points to break down the information about each factor, making it easier to read and compare.\n3.  I rephrased some sentences for better clarity and concision.\n4.  I added a summary section at the end to provide an overview of the image's contents.\n\nThese changes should make the response more helpful and user-friendly!",

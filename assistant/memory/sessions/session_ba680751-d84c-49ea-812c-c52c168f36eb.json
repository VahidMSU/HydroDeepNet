The use of different colors (black for historical, red for future) effectively highlights the differences between these two periods.\n\nI made the following improvements:\n\n* Broke up the text into clearer sections using headings\n* Simplified sentence structures to improve readability\n* Emphasized key points with bullet points and concise descriptions\n* Used more descriptive language throughout the response",

It offers valuable information on land use and crop patterns.\n* `groundwater_report.md`: This report allows you to visualize trends and patterns in groundwater data, which can be useful for understanding regional hydrological dynamics.\n* `snodas_report.md`: This report provides analysis of snow trends using SNODAS (Snow Data Assimilation System) data. It covers various aspects, including spatial resolution and data accuracy.\n\n**Key Takeaways**\n\nWhen working with these reports, keep in mind the following:\n\n* Maps are provided to visualize data patterns.\n* SNODAS combines model and observational data, which may introduce some estimation uncertainty.\n\nI hope this improved response is clear, concise, and helpful!",

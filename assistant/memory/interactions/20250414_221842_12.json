  "response": "**PRISM Data Overview**\n\nI've identified two relevant files containing PRISM data. Here's a brief summary of each:\n\n1. **MODIS Comprehensive Report**: This document provides an in-depth analysis of MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) data products, covering aspects such as methodology and results.\n2. **Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) Heatmap (MOD13Q1_NDVI_spatial.png)**: This image presents a visual representation of vegetation health or density, using a heatmap titled \"Normalized Difference Vegetation Index - Image 1\". The heatmap is divided into two main sections.\n\nPlease let me know if you'd like me to provide more information on either of these files!",

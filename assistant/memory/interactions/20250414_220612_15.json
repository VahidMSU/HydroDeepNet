  "response": "I found three relevant files related to NSRDB:\n\n1. **MODIS Comprehensive Report**: This markdown file appears to be a detailed report on an analysis of MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) data, which might be related to the NSRDB.\n2. **LAI Map (500m spatial resolution)**: The image shows a leaf area index (LAI) map, indicating the amount of leaf tissue per unit ground area. This could provide insights into vegetation health and density.\n3. **NDVI Heatmap**: The heatmap titled \"Normalized Difference Vegetation Index - Image 1\" presents a visualization of vegetation activity, which might be connected to NSRDB data.\n\nPlease let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any of these findings or if there's anything else I can help with!",

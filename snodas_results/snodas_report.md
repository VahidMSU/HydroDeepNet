## Monthly Snow Analysis

The monthly analysis shows the average patterns and variability of snow variables by month over the 2010-2015 period.

![Monthly Analysis](snodas_monthly_analysis.png)

The plots show the mean monthly values (line), the standard deviation range (darker shading), and the minimum-maximum range (lighter shading) over the analyzed period.

This visualization helps identify:

- The typical seasonal cycle of snow variables
- The months with highest uncertainty/variability
- The overall pattern of snow accumulation and melt

## Time Series Analysis

The time series shows the change in snow variables over the entire period.

## Hydrological Implications

### Snowpack Implications

No statistically significant trends in snow variables were detected in the analyzed period. However, year-to-year variability in snowpack conditions remains an important consideration for water resource planning and management.

### Seasonal Water Resource Considerations

Water resource planning should take into account the seasonal patterns observed in the snow data, particularly the timing of peak SWE and snowmelt. Management practices should be adapted to the local snow seasonality to optimize water storage, flood control, and water supply allocation.

## Water Supply Implications

The maximum snow water equivalent for the area is approximately 674.2 mm, representing significant water storage in the snowpack. The estimated total snowmelt contribution is 817075.9 mm per year on average, which suggests:

- **Significant snowpack contribution**: The region has substantial snow water storage, making snowmelt a critical component of the annual water budget and seasonal water availability.

Understanding the timing and rate of snowmelt is crucial for water resource management in this region, including reservoir operations, flood control, and water supply planning.
## Applications and Recommendations

### Water Management Applications

- **Reservoir operations**: Adjust storage and release schedules based on snowpack conditions and melt timing
- **Flood forecasting**: Use SWE and melt rate data to predict spring runoff volumes and timing
- **Drought planning**: Monitor snowpack as an early indicator of potential water scarcity
- **Water allocation**: Plan water deliveries based on projected snowmelt contributions

### Hydrological Applications

- **Streamflow forecasting**: Use SWE data to predict spring and summer runoff volumes
- **Hydropower planning**: Schedule generation based on expected snowmelt patterns
- **Ecological considerations**: Manage for environmental flows based on natural snowmelt regimes
- **Climate change assessment**: Monitor trends in snowpack as indicators of changing conditions

## Data Source and Methodology

This analysis is based on SNODAS (Snow Data Assimilation System) data. SNODAS is a modeling and data assimilation system developed by the National Weather Service's National Operational Hydrologic Remote Sensing Center (NOHRSC) to provide estimates of snow cover and associated parameters.

**Processing steps:**

1. Extraction of raw data from HDF5 database
2. Spatial subsetting to the region of interest
3. Temporal aggregation to annual values
4. Statistical analysis and visualization
5. Trend detection using linear regression methods

### Limitations

- The analysis is limited by the temporal range and resolution of the available data
- SNODAS combines model and observational data, introducing some uncertainty
- Spatial resolution may not capture fine-scale variability in complex terrain
- Snow processes are complex and influenced by many factors not fully represented in this analysis

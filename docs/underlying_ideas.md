We are going to write a paper about the system that we established to generate SWAT+ models across CONUS. 

Intended Journal: Environmental Modeling and Software

### Alternative titles:
1- Development of a scalable system for high-resolution hydrogeological modeling for conterminous United States
2- SWATGenX: An automated Web application platform for generating SWAT+ with NHDPlus HR across CONUS

### Aim:
Developing a system capable of genrating hydrological models with high resolution using publically available datasets. 

### Objectives:
1- System desgin for the automated platform
2- Testing the approach with full capability for Michigan (59 SWAT+gwflow models) and testing across CONUS (630 models)


### Abstract
An overview of the work, aim, objectives, methods and product

### Introduction:

Paragraph1-Importance of hydrology and computional hydrology in addressing 
Paragraph2-Previous works
Paragraph3-Shortcomming of current approachs
Paragraph4-Our propopsed platform
Paragraph5-Describing Aim, objectives, contribution and innovation


### Methodology: 

section1: Overview of our system and flowchart
section2: data sources
section3: details of the SWATGenX implementation using national datasets for SWAT+ generation
section4: details of groundwater modeling implementation and integraton with SWAT+ for SWAT+gwflow generation


### Results:

Section1: SWAT+gwflow models performance for Michigan
section2: Details of the calibration performance
section3: SWAT+ models extracted for US
(probably there will be more sections based on the results)

### Disscussion
section1: Limitation, computional speed

### Data and Software availability
section2: Web application and API of the SWATGenX

### Conclusion

Some bullet points about our key finding and contributions and future works.

Introduction
Regional hydrological modeling is crucial for evaluating the impacts of natural and human-induced changes on water resources. Such models play a central role in water resources management, guiding flood control, water supply planning, and ecosystem conservation decisions. They facilitate informed decision-making for sustainable development and provide actionable information for communities and authorities to preserve water quality and quantity. In agricultural landscapes, hydrological models are equally indispensable: they help optimize irrigation scheduling, estimate crop water requirements, and assess how farming practices affect water availability and quality. By improving agricultural water-use efficiency and sustainability, these models bridge environmental and agricultural research, informing policies that balance crop production with conservation. Robust hydrologic models guide resource managers and stakeholders in making science-based land and water management decisions across scales – from farm fields to regional watersheds.
Building and deploying hydrological models at large scales presents several well-recognized challenges. Data acquisition and integration is a significant hurdle: a comprehensive model requires merging data from disparate sources (high-resolution hydrography, climate grids, land cover, soils, etc.), which is labor-intensive and technically complex. Even though recent geospatial datasets offer unprecedented detail – for example, the NHDPlus High Resolution dataset (NHDPlus HR) provides a ~1:24,000-scale hydrographic network with on the order of 27 million stream reaches across the contiguous U.S.– assembling and processing these massive datasets into a modeling framework is non-trivial. Computational constraints also limit widespread modeling: large-scale watershed simulations can be memory and CPU intensive, often requiring high-performance computing. 
Advanced physics-based models (e.g. fully coupled surface-subsurface simulators) capable of capturing fine-scale, rapidly changing ecosystem dynamics are typically confined to academic or research settings because they are time-consuming and expensive to build, and demand specialized expertise. As a result, many decision-support tools rely on simplified models or coarse assumptions that sacrifice detail for the sake of tractability. 
These constraints are evident in existing national-scale modeling efforts. For instance, the National Agroecosystem Model (NAM) developed by Texas A&M and the USGS National Hydrologic Model (NHM) have had to rely on moderate-resolution hydrographic data (the 1:100,000-scale NHD dataset) when simulating across the entire country. The 1:100k stream network contains roughly 2.5 million identifiable river reaches, an order of magnitude fewer than NHDPlus HR’s ~27 million reaches. Such coarse representation inevitably simplifies river connectivity and basin detail. Consequences of these compromises include:
Missed small-scale features: Lower-resolution hydrography can omit small streams, headwaters, divergent flow paths, isolated basins, and lake–river connections, leading to inaccurate water routing in the model.
Limited local relevance: Aggregating inputs and outputs over large subbasins may conceal pollution hot-spots or critical source areas, limiting the model’s ability to target site-specific interventions.
Reduced stakeholder confidence: Coarse models yield outputs at a scale that may not resonate with local stakeholders. In contrast, high-resolution data provide more credible and detailed results for policymakers, improving confidence in model-informed decisions.
Another prominent effort, Princeton’s HydroGEN project, highlights additional challenges of scaling up hydrologic models. HydroGEN (Hydrologic Scenario Generation) is an ongoing initiative to employ machine learning alongside physics-based modeling (using the ParFlow model) to generate national water resource simulations. While ambitious, the project underscores the immense data-handling and computational burden involved. Even with modern cloud infrastructure, the team noted the “significant challenge of building a platform that can handle the model generation and large data transfers” required for nationwide high-resolution modeling. In short, preparing large-scale hydrological models today faces a dual challenge: leveraging increasingly detailed datasets and computational tools, while keeping the process efficient and accessible to non-expert users.
Proposed Platform and Comparison with Existing Models
We developed a scalable, automated platform for high-resolution watershed modeling to address these limitations. The proposed system utilizes modern data streams and computing approaches, effectively bridging the gap between detailed data and user-friendly model generation. At its core is an automation framework (nicknamed SWATGenX) that builds a SWAT+ hydrological model for any given watershed outlet. We harness the rich detail of NHDPlus HR for delineating streams and subbasins, ensuring that even small tributaries, headwater catchments, and water bodies are represented in the model. Using NHDPlus HR as the hydrographic underlay, our approach captures far more detailed river networks than frameworks like NAM built on 1:100k-scale data. In practical terms, our generated models can include the myriad of minor channels and wetlands that large-scale NAM or NHM simulations might aggregate or ignore, improving the physical realism of water routing and connectivity.
Beyond hydrography, the platform integrates complementary high-resolution datasets seamlessly. For example, we utilize gridded climate inputs such as PRISM and LOCA2 for precipitation and temperature, at ~4 km resolution or finer, and the National Solar Radiation Database for solar radiation, wind, and humidity data. These data are automatically fetched and formatted for the model, relieving users from manual data processing. The entire workflow is orchestrated through a hierarchical database and APIs that connect to national data services. Notably, the system taps into the USGS National Water Information System (NWIS) API to obtain observed streamflow and basin characteristics for over 36,000 gauging stations across the United States. In doing so, our platform can generate a ready-to-run SWAT+ model for any USGS station in the nation with minimal user effort – the user simply specifies a station of interest, and the backend retrieves all necessary hydrographic, climatic, and geospatial data to configure the model.
This on-demand model generation capability stands in contrast to previous large-scale models. The NAM, for instance, was essentially a one-time compilation of a SWAT+ framework for the conterminous US – powerful for national assessments, but not easily customized to arbitrary user-defined locations or updated with new data. Our approach, in comparison, behaves like a model factory that can rapidly produce customized, high-resolution watershed models anywhere, anytime. Likewise, whereas HydroGEN aims to produce nationwide hydrologic simulations through machine learning acceleration, our platform focuses on transparency and physical modeling at the watershed scale. In other words, rather than training surrogate models, we build the actual process-based model (SWAT+ in this case) but make the setup nearly instantaneous from the user’s perspective. This strategy has the advantage of leveraging well-vetted hydrological simulation software (SWAT+) and avoiding potential generalization errors from purely ML-derived predictions, at the cost of running the process-based model. Thanks to data availability and cloud computing advances, however, we show that high-resolution models can be generated and run efficiently, even for regional-scale applications, without resorting to overly coarse assumptions.
This work introduces a novel platform and demonstrates its capabilities through a regional case study, with several key contributions: (1) High-resolution model generation at scale: We provide one of the first frameworks to construct coupled automatically groundwater–surface water models at a continental scale using fine-resolution hydrographic data. Our system is built to be highly efficient, assembling all requisite inputs (terrain, land use, soil, climate, and observed flows) optimized for any given watershed outlet. The online platform developed allows users – whether hydrologists, agricultural scientists, or water managers – to generate a calibrated SWAT+ model for any USGS gauging station on demand. By connecting our workflow to the NWIS streamflow database and other national data services, the platform ensures that model setup and calibration data for thousands of watersheds are readily accessible. This level of automation and accessibility is a significant step forward, reducing the barrier to entry for high-resolution hydrological modeling.
(2) Integration of groundwater and surface water: A novel aspect of our modeling approach is the seamless integration of groundwater processes within the surface water model. We take advantage of the recently developed gwflow module in SWAT+, which enables the simulation of groundwater-surface water interactions in each watershed. As part of our study, we built and calibrated 58 paired models in Michigan’s Lower Peninsula – each pair consisting of a standard SWAT+ model and a SWAT+ model with the groundwater module activated – to evaluate the improvements gained by coupling groundwater flow. To our knowledge, this extensive calibration exercise (covering basins ranging from small <100 km² catchments to larger ~3,000 km² basins) is unprecedented in both number and resolution of models calibrated within a region. The result is a dataset of 58 high-resolution watershed models (spanning ~100,000 km² total area) that not only validate the platform’s scalability but also shed light on the impact of groundwater inclusion on model performance.
(3) Regional application and evaluation: By applying our framework to the Michigan Lower Peninsula (a region with diverse hydrology, land use, and significant agriculture), we demonstrate the platform’s real-world utility. The models for 58 USGS stations were calibrated and validated against observed streamflow, allowing us to assess model accuracy and identify any systematic biases. This case study highlights how the platform can quickly stand up a network of models for an entire region, enabling comparative analysis. For example, stakeholders in Michigan can now explore water-budget components or run pollutant scenarios consistently across all major basins in the peninsula, something that would have taken prohibitive effort to assemble without our automated approach. The successful implementation in Michigan builds confidence that the framework can be expanded to other regions or even nationally. Ultimately, the significant contributions of this work are the development of an open, high-resolution hydrologic modeling platform and the demonstration of its capabilities through a comprehensive regional modeling effort. These contributions lay the groundwork for more accessible and data-rich hydrological models that support better environmental and agricultural decision-making across the United States.

S1. SWAT+ Hydrographical Model Construction Using NHDPlus HR
This document outlines the methodology for constructing predefined SWAT+ models based on the NHDPlus High-Resolution (HR) database.
S1.1. Data Preparation and Import
The primary hydrographical data were extracted from the NHDPlus database for the Vector Processing Units (VPUIDs) of 405, 406, 407, 408, 409, and 410 covering the entire Michigan lower Peninsula.
WBDHU8 and WBDHU12 represent the basin or subbasin boundary depending on the scale of interest.
NHDFlowline: representing streamlines.
NHDPlusCatchment: representing the drainage area of a streamline.
NHDWaterbody: Representing reservoirs, lakes, wetlands, and playa.
NHDPlusFlowlineVAA: Value-Added Attribute table for streams and catchments characteristics. The following attribute values were used to prepare the SWAT+ predefined watershed.
VPUID: Identifier for Vector Processing Unit (equivalent to HUC4)
NHDPlusID: Common key among NHDPlusFlowlines, NHDPlusCatchment, and NHDPlusVAA.
StreamOrder: The stream order is based on the Strahler method.
UpHydroSeq: The hydrological sequence number for the upstream.
HydroSeq: The hydrological sequence number for the flowline.
DnHydroSeq: The hydrological sequence number for the downstream.
StartFlag: Flag indicating if the flowline is a headwater.
TerminalFl: Flag indicating if the flowline is a terminal point (outlet).
Divergence: Indicates if a flowline diverges into multiple downstream paths.
Permanent_Identifier: A permanent identifier for each flowline.
WBArea_Permanent_Identifier: Identifier for the associated water body area.
MaxElevSmo: Smoothed maximum elevation of the flowline.
MinElevSmo: Smoothed minimum elevation of the flowline.
AreaSqKm: Drainage area in square kilometers.
LengthKM: Original length of the flowline in kilometers (later converted to meters).
TotDASqKm: Total drainage area in square kilometers.
S1.2. General preprocessing:
CRS: The geometries were projected to the UTM Zone of the respective VPUID.
Removing Second Divergence: Streams with a divergence code of 2 were eliminated, and their corresponding drainage area was merged to their downstream.
Data Consistency Check: We excluded flowlines that did not have corresponding drainage areas.
Coastal Line Removal: Flowlines designated as coastal lines were removed from the dataset.
Isolated Streams: Basins without upstream or downstream hydro sequence but with identifiable streams in NHDPlusCatchment were considered standalone subbasins with outlets.
Length Unit Conversion: The lengths of the streams, originally in kilometers, were converted to meters.
Drop Calculation: SWAT+ requires drop, representing the difference between a flowline’s maximum and minimum elevation. We calculate the drop for each stream based on the MaxElevSmo and MinElevSmo features in NHDPlus HR.
Reset Flags: The Start and Terminal flags were reset based on the above revision.
Identifying Hydrologic Unit Codes (HUC): The catchment centroids were spatially joined with the HUC shapefiles. The process is carried out separately for HUC8 and HUC12 levels.

S1.4. Configuring NHDPlus Data Based on SWAT+ Hydrographical Logic: The One-Outlet Rule
SWAT model has a one-outlet rule that requires each subbasin to have only one stream flowing into one downstream subbasin. However, HUC12 boundaries, when used along with NHDPlus HR, often need to adhere to this rule, leading to subbasins with multiple outlets. Several conditions that violate this rule include 1-isolated subbasins within a HUC12, 2- the confluence of two streams draining into a downstream subbasin, and 3- a normal condition when a subbasin has different outlets leading to two or more downstream subbasins.
A systematic search is implemented to identify the number of outlets in subbasins to enforce the one-outlet rule. An outlet is where a stream exits a subbasin, either entering another subbasin or leaving the hydrological domain. In cases where a subbasin has more than one outlet, we perform a recursive function to trace all upstream segments for each outlet. These segments for each outlet subsequently form new subbasins, splitting the initial multi-outlet subbasins into multiple single-outlet subbasins. This process involves iterative checks to ensure all subbasins adhere to the one-outlet criterion.
S1.5. Defining Flowline-Waterbody Connections
To incorporate waterbodies into the hydrograph of the SWAT model, it is essential to identify lake inlet and outlet segments within flowlines. This includes the following steps:
- Stream Classification: Based on their NHDPlus Ftype feature of waterbodies, we categorize streams into four types: lakes, reservoirs, wetlands, and playas.
- Area Threshold: Waterbodies can be excluded based on the threshold area. We retrained all waterbodies.
- Lake Identification (LakeId): To identify LakeId in flowlines, flowline data is merged with waterbody datasets, aligning the ‘Permanent_Identifier’ from waterbodies with the ‘WBArea_Permanent_Identifier’ in flowlines. Flowlines associated with lakes are initially considered as LakeWithin.
- Lake Inlets (LakeIn): LakeIn segments are identified by traversing from headwater to outlet. Segments draining into a lake (indicated by a downstream LakeId) are named LakeIn.
- Updating LakeWithin: All segments within a lake’s boundary are initially classified as LakeWithin. This classification is updated as outflow segments (LakeOut) are identified.
- Lake Outlets (LakeOut): Any LakeWithin without having LakeId in downstream hydrosequence.
- Main Lake Outlet (LakeMain): LakeMain is determined based on stream order, selecting the segment with the highest order in each lake as the primary outflow channel. This might cause an issue, but we could not find a better solution, as this is the limitation of SWAT+: each lake has only one outlet.
- Special Cases Handling: When creating SWAT+ lakes from NHDPlus data, certain exceptional cases are addressed. For instance, adjacent lakes in NHDPlus data with different permanent IDs merge to share the same LakeId, or if a lake’s outlet coincides with the watershed’s outlet, the last LakeWithin segment before the outlet is specifically designated as the LakeOut.
S1.6 Quality assurance check:
- Single Association for Streams and Catchments: Confirmed that each stream is associated with only one catchment and vice versa.
- Unique Subbasin Association: Verified that each catchment or stream is associated with only one subbasin.
- Lake Outlet Requirement: Ensured every lake has at least one outlet.
- Avoidance of Circular Hydrographs: Checked for and eliminated any divergence that could cause circular hydrographs.
- Single Outlet per Subbasin: Ensure each subbasin has only one outlet.
- ID Initialization: Ensured that channel and Lake IDs start from 1.

S3. Groundwater static data generation and evaluation
We acquired groundwater data from Wellogic, which is an Internet-based data entry program developed by the State of Michigan that provides an easy method for water well drilling contractors to submit water well records. The groundwater dataset comprises over 600,000 unique well records, including lithological data such as aquifer thickness, hydraulic conductivity, static water level, and transmissivity. We rasterize the data for each variable into 30m and 250m resolution. We have provided the following statistical measures for each variable: number of observations, minimum, 2.5th percentile, mean, median, standard deviation, 97.5th percentile, and maximum. Additionally, we have conducted several non-parametric normality tests (Shapiro-Wilk, Kolmogorov-Smirnov, Anderson-Darling, and Lilliefors) to evaluate whether the data follows a normal distribution.

S3.2. Statistical Summary
Table S2 lists the statistics and the results of the normality tests for each groundwater variable. In all cases presented here, the normality tests indicate that the data does not follow a normal distribution. This is not unusual for large environmental datasets, which often exhibit skewness, kurtosis, or other deviations from normality due to natural variability and measurement processes.

S2.3. Overview of Groundwater Station Data Analysis
Figure S3 presents a series of Quantile-Quantile (Q-Q) plots for groundwater transmissivity and aquifer depth, each aiming to assess the normality of the data distribution for the respective parameter. Each subplot features a histogram with a Kernel Density Estimate (KDE) in blue, overlaid on the primary Y-axis, which represents the data density. This offers an initial visualization of the data distribution for quick assessment. On the secondary Y-axis, red dots represent “Sample Quantiles,” which are the sorted observed values of the parameter being examined. These are plotted against the theoretical quantiles of a standard normal distribution, calculated based on the mean and standard deviation of the observed data. The closer these points lie along a 1:1 line, the more the data adheres to a normal distribution.

Figure S3: Quantile-Quantile (Q-Q) Plots for Groundwater Hydraulic Parameters. Each subplot displays a histogram with a Kernel Density Estimate (KDE) in blue on the primary Y-axis, serving as a quick visual assessment of data distribution for a specific parameter. The red dots on the secondary Y-axis represent the Sample Quantiles—sorted observed values—plotted against theoretical quantiles from a standard normal distribution. 

S3.4. Empirical Bayesian Kriging
Empirical Bayesian Kriging (EBK) is a robust geostatistical interpolation method employed in this study to interpolate observed groundwater hydraulic properties spatially. Unlike traditional kriging methods, which rely on a single variogram model, EBK uses an ensemble of semi-variogram models. This ensemble approach allows EBK to capture better groundwater data’s spatial variability, continuity, and uncertainty. 
S3.4.1. EBK model parameters setting:
Cell Size: The resolution of the output raster is set to 250 meters.
Transformation Type: The “EMPIRICAL” transformation stabilizes variance across the dataset.
Maximum Local Points: Up to 250 neighboring points are considered for each estimation, balancing computational efficiency and spatial accuracy.
Overlap Factor: An overlap factor of 2 ensures smooth transitions between local models.
Number of semi-variograms: To capture the spatial variability within the dataset, 150 semi-variogram models are generated.
Semi-variogram Model Type: The “EXPONENTIAL” model is selected because it is suitable for representing the spatial correlation structure of groundwater data.

S3.5. MODFLOW and groundwater modeling
Using the above-generated data and the Flopy library, we created MODFLOW models corresponding to the 58 SWAT+ models presented in this study. Figure S4 shows the NSE, RMSE, and PBIAS errors of the 58 MODFLOW models generated corresponding to the SWAT+ model watersheds. Accordingly, the median RMSE error in the simulated vs. observed heads is 8m, and the NSE is skewed to 1 with -3% PBIAS. The metrics show the excellent performance of MODFLOW models for static simulation using the data generated by EBK.

S4.1. National Hydrographical Dataset High-Resolution
The NHD has undergone significant evolution, driven by advances in geospatial technology and increasing data resolution requirements. Here is a summary of its development based on (Dewald, 2017):
Initial Development:
Reach File Version 1 (RF1): Developed in the late 1970s by Robert C. Horn of the EPA’s Office of Water, RF1 utilized USGS topographic maps and NOAA enhancements to create a 1:500,000-scale digital stream network. It included stream names, addressing systems, catchments, and streamflow estimates.
Reach File Version 3 (RF3): The RF3, developed in the early 1990s, provided a more detailed 1:100,000-scale network, integrating RF3 stream attributes with USGS Digital Line Graph hydrography.
Medium Resolution NHD:
NHD: The integration of RF3 and USGS hydrography resulted in the 1:100,000-scale National Hydrography Dataset (NHD), designed for maintainability and broader application through GIS technology. Production began in 1997 and was completed by 2000.
NHDPlus Versions 1 and 2: NHDPlus was developed to enhance the medium-resolution NHD with additional attributes like streamflow estimates and catchments, based on hydrologically conditioned elevation data (30m). NHDPlusV2, released in 2012, included significant updates and additional features.
High-Resolution NHD:
NHDPlus HR: In 2015, the NHDPlus High Resolution (HR) aimed to deliver a 1:24,000-scale or better hydrography network. It uses high-resolution NHD data, 10m elevation data, and Watershed Boundary Dataset (WBD) boundaries. This high-resolution dataset is over 20 times larger than the medium-resolution NHD.
Future Developments:
Lidar-Based NHD: The next generation of NHD is expected to leverage lidar technology, achieving resolutions of 1:5,000 or better. This will provide even more detailed and accurate hydrography data, supporting a wide range of water quality and quantity modeling applications.
This progression illustrates geospatial surface water frameworks’ increasing precision and utility, moving from the initial 1:500,000-scale RF1 to the anticipated lidar-based 1:5,000-scale datasets.

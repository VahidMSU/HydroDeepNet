    # SEQN is the sequence number of the map unit in the map unit table;
    # SEQN and CMPPCT mean sequence number and soil component percent, respectively
    # S5ID is described in the SWAT User Guide as:
    #“The user may also link the soils map to the database via Soils5ID number. When the “S5ID”
    #option is chosen, data for the specified soil series is used to represent the map unit. In order to
    #use the “S5ID” option, the soil database for the entire US must be installed”⁽⁵⁾

This hybrid CNN-Transformer model, `CNNTransformerRegressor`, merges the power of convolutional networks for spatial feature extraction with Transformers for capturing long-range dependencies in a U-Net-like structure.

**Key elements:**

1. **Positional Encoding:** Adds spatial information to the transformer, since Transformers are permutation-invariant.
   
2. **CNN Downsampling Path:** Four convolutional blocks (`DownBlockWithSE`) progressively downsample the input while maintaining feature representation through Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) blocks to emphasize important channels.

3. **Bottleneck:** Connects the CNN and Transformer, ensuring the output from the CNN can be transformed into a sequence for the Transformer to process.

4. **Transformer Encoder:** Introduced in the bottleneck, the transformer layer captures global dependencies, useful in capturing complex patterns in data over long sequences.

5. **Upsampling Path:** Four upsampling layers (`UpBlockWithSE`) perform the reverse process of the encoder to restore the resolution. Skip connections are used to help maintain fine-grained details.

6. **Final Output:** A final convolutional layer generates the desired output, making it suitable for regression tasks (without any activation function at the end).

### Overall Model Usage:
This architecture is effective for tasks that require both spatial feature extraction (handled by the CNN) and long-range sequence understanding (handled by the Transformer). It could be applied to fields like remote sensing, medical image analysis, or any regression problem where capturing complex, long-distance dependencies in images is crucial.



The architecture described in the model combines concepts from both **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** and **Transformers** and aligns with several hybrid approaches that have been proposed recently in the field of deep learning, particularly for tasks requiring both local feature extraction and global context awareness.

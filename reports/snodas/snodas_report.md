## Monthly Snow Analysis

The monthly analysis shows the average patterns and variability of snow variables by month over the 2010-2020 period.

![Monthly Analysis](snodas_monthly_analysis.png)

The plots show the mean monthly values (line), the standard deviation range (darker shading), and the minimum-maximum range (lighter shading) over the analyzed period.

This visualization helps identify:

- The typical seasonal cycle of snow variables
- The months with highest uncertainty/variability
- The overall pattern of snow accumulation and melt

### Snow Water Equivalent Seasonality

The highest SWE typically occurs in **December**, while the lowest SWE is in **October**. The primary snow season includes: January, February, March, April, May, June, July, August, September, October, November, December.

### Snowmelt Seasonality

The highest snowmelt rates typically occur in **July** (17216.47 mm/day), which corresponds to the primary snowmelt season.

The primary snowmelt season includes: February, March, April, May, June, July, August, September, October, November, December.

## Spatial Distribution

## Hydrological Implications

### Snowpack Implications

The analysis indicates a **significant increase in snowmelt rates**. Increased snowmelt may lead to:

- Higher peak flows in rivers and streams
- Potential increases in spring flooding risk
- Changes in the timing of water availability
- Possible impacts on aquatic ecosystems due to altered flow regimes

### Seasonal Water Resource Considerations

Water resource planning should take into account the seasonal patterns observed in the snow data, particularly the timing of peak SWE and snowmelt. Management practices should be adapted to the local snow seasonality to optimize water storage, flood control, and water supply allocation.

## Water Supply Implications

The maximum snow water equivalent for the area is approximately 2030.8 mm, representing significant water storage in the snowpack. The estimated total snowmelt contribution is 1664234.1 mm over the entire period, which suggests:

- **Significant snowpack contribution**: The region has substantial snow water storage, making snowmelt a critical component of the annual water budget and seasonal water availability.

Understanding the timing and rate of snowmelt is crucial for water resource management in this region, including reservoir operations, flood control, and water supply planning.
## Applications and Recommendations

### Water Management Applications

- **Reservoir operations**: Adjust storage and release schedules based on snowpack conditions and melt timing
- **Flood forecasting**: Use SWE and melt rate data to predict spring runoff volumes and timing
- **Drought planning**: Monitor snowpack as an early indicator of potential water scarcity
- **Water allocation**: Plan water deliveries based on projected snowmelt contributions

### Hydrological Applications

- **Streamflow forecasting**: Use SWE data to predict spring and summer runoff volumes
- **Hydropower planning**: Schedule generation based on expected snowmelt patterns
- **Ecological considerations**: Manage for environmental flows based on natural snowmelt regimes
- **Climate change assessment**: Monitor trends in snowpack as indicators of changing conditions

## Data Source and Methodology

This analysis is based on SNODAS (Snow Data Assimilation System) data. SNODAS is a modeling and data assimilation system developed by the National Weather Service's National Operational Hydrologic Remote Sensing Center (NOHRSC) to provide estimates of snow cover and associated parameters.

**Processing steps:**

1. Extraction of raw data from HDF5 database
2. Spatial subsetting to the region of interest
3. Temporal aggregation to monthly values
4. Statistical analysis and visualization
5. Trend detection using linear regression methods

### Limitations

- The analysis is limited by the temporal range and resolution of the available data
- SNODAS combines model and observational data, introducing some uncertainty
- Spatial resolution may not capture fine-scale variability in complex terrain
- Snow processes are complex and influenced by many factors not fully represented in this analysis

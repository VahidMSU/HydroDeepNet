## Agricultural Diversity Analysis

Agricultural diversity is an important indicator of farming system resilience and ecosystem health. Higher diversity can reduce pest and disease pressure and improve soil health.

## Crop Rotation Patterns

The heatmap below shows common crop rotations observed in the agricultural data, indicating which crops tend to follow others in sequence:

## Agricultural Implications

### Observed Agricultural Trends and Their Implications

- **Increasing row crop production**: Both corn and soybean acreage have increased, suggesting a focus on commodity crops. This may indicate intensification of agricultural production, which could have implications for soil health and nutrient management.

- **Declining wheat production**: The decrease in wheat acreage may indicate shifting market conditions, climate factors, or changes in farm management strategies. Wheat is often a key component of crop rotations, so its reduction might affect overall rotation diversity.

- **Increasing crop diversity**: There has been an expansion in the variety of crops grown in the region, which may contribute to reduced pest pressure, improved soil health, and greater agricultural resilience.

### Non-Agricultural Land Cover Change Implications

- **Forest cover reduction**: Decreases in forest cover could impact ecosystem services like carbon storage, water filtration, and wildlife habitat.

- **Wetland expansion**: Changes in wetland areas affect water quality, flood control, and biodiversity. Wetlands provide critical ecosystem services including water purification and wildlife habitat.

### Management Recommendations

Based on the observed land use patterns and changes, the following management practices may be beneficial:

1. **Diversified crop rotations**: Incorporate a wider variety of crops to improve soil health and reduce pest pressure
2. **Cover crops**: Implement cover crops during fallow periods to protect soil, fix nitrogen, and add organic matter
3. **Conservation practices**: Consider conservation tillage, buffer strips, and contour farming in areas with high erosion risk
4. **Precision agriculture**: Use precision technology to optimize inputs and reduce environmental impacts
5. **Integrated pest management**: Adopt IPM practices to reduce pesticide use while maintaining effective pest control

6. **Natural area conservation**: Protect remaining forests and wetlands to maintain ecosystem services
7. **Habitat corridors**: Establish or maintain corridors between natural areas to support wildlife movement

## Data Source and Methodology

This report is based on the USDA National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) Cropland Data Layer (CDL), which provides geo-referenced, crop-specific land cover data at 30-meter resolution. The CDL includes both agricultural crops and non-agricultural land cover types like forests, water bodies, and developed areas.

**Processing steps:**

1. Extraction of CDL data for the specified region and time period
2. Separation of agricultural crops from non-agricultural land cover types
3. Aggregation and calculation of area statistics by crop type and land cover class
4. Analysis of temporal trends, changes, and diversity metrics
5. Visualization of key patterns and relationships

### Limitations

- CDL accuracy varies by crop type and region (typically 85-95% for major crops, lower for non-agricultural classes)
- Small fields or mixed plantings may not be accurately represented
- Analysis is limited to the temporal range of available data
- Local factors affecting land use decisions (e.g., specific markets, infrastructure) are not captured

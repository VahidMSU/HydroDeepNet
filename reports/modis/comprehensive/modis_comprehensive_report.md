## Cross-Product Analysis

### Product Comparison

The following chart shows normalized values (z-scores) of different MODIS products to facilitate comparison of their temporal patterns:

![Product Comparison](cross_product/products_comparison.png)

Normalization allows comparison of products with different units and magnitudes.

### Product Correlations

The following heatmap shows the Pearson correlation coefficients between different MODIS products:

![Product Correlations](cross_product/product_correlations.png)

Strong positive correlations suggest that the products vary similarly over time, while negative correlations indicate inverse relationships. Products with correlation close to zero vary independently of each other.

<a id='methodology'></a>
## Methodology

This analysis follows these processing steps:

1. **Data Extraction**: Raw MODIS data is extracted from the HDF5 database
2. **Quality Control**: Invalid values are masked and scale factors applied
3. **Statistical Analysis**: Time series and spatial statistics are calculated
4. **Anomaly Detection**: Data is compared to baseline climatology
5. **Visualization**: Multiple visualization types are generated to highlight patterns
6. **Cross-product Analysis**: Products are compared and correlation analyzed

### Data Processing

For each MODIS product, the following processing is applied:

- Spatial subsetting to the region of interest
- Application of appropriate scaling factors
- Removal of invalid data points (marked as -999 or outside valid ranges)
- Calculation of spatial statistics over the region
- Temporal aggregation for annual and seasonal patterns
- Trend and anomaly analysis

<a id='data-sources'></a>
## Data Sources

This analysis uses the following MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) products:

- **MOD13Q1_NDVI**: Normalized Difference Vegetation Index
- **MOD13Q1_EVI**: Enhanced Vegetation Index
- **MOD15A2H_Lai_500m**: Leaf Area Index
- **MOD16A2_ET**: Evapotranspiration

MODIS data is collected by sensors aboard NASA's Terra and Aqua satellites. The original data products are provided by NASA's Earth Observing System Data and Information System (EOSDIS).

<a id='limitations'></a>
## Limitations

This analysis has several limitations to consider:

- **Spatial Resolution**: The MODIS data used has a resolution of 250-500m, which may not capture fine-scale patterns
- **Cloud Interference**: Despite quality control, some cloud effects may remain in the data
- **Temporal Coverage**: The analysis is limited to the available time period in the database
- **Algorithmic Uncertainties**: Each MODIS product has inherent uncertainties in its retrieval algorithm
- **Regional Biases**: The accuracy of satellite retrievals can vary by region and land cover type

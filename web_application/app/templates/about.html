    <h3>Our Vision</h3>
    <p>
      This project was funded by the
      <strong>MSU Institute of Water Research</strong> with the goal of
      addressing critical challenges in hydrological modeling and water resource
      management in Michigan. Our focus is to develop a scalable, physically
      informed deep learning model that predicts high-resolution hydrological
      variables, especially groundwater recharge, with applications across
      various watersheds in the United States.
    </p>

    <h3>The Problem</h3>
    <p>
      Estimating groundwater recharge is a computationally intensive and complex
      task, requiring significant resources for calibration and simulation using
      physically based models. These challenges become more pronounced when
      expanding to high-resolution spatiotemporal predictions over large
      geographic areas. Moreover, the impact of climate change and human
      activities on groundwater systems demands innovative approaches to better
      understand and manage these vital resources.
    </p>

    <h3>Our Approach</h3>
    <p>
      We propose a hybrid framework that combines the strengths of physically
      based hydrological models like
      <strong>SWAT+</strong> with cutting-edge deep learning techniques. By
      leveraging a CNN-Transformer architecture, our system learns from SWAT+
      model outputs and national climatological datasets to predict groundwater
      recharge for regions lacking direct monitoring or hydrological models.

    <ul>
      <li>
        Integration of <strong>SWAT+</strong> simulations with high-resolution
        datasets such as PRISM, LOCA2, NSRDB, and gSSURGO.
      </li>
      <li>
        Development of a novel CNN-Transformer model with 128 million parameters
        for spatiotemporal regression tasks.
      </li>
      <li>
        Deployment of scalable workflows to predict hydrological variables using
        only publicly available data, enabling collaborative research and model
        reuse.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Key Objectives</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Provide a scalable framework for hydrological data modeling across the
        United States.
      </li>
      <li>
        Develop a deep learning architecture capable of high-resolution,
        spatiotemporal predictions.
      </li>
      <li>
        Facilitate collaboration by creating a platform for researchers to
        access data and models.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Collaboration and Accessibility</h3>
    <p>
      Our system is designed to foster collaboration by serving as a centralized
      environment where researchers can contribute and utilize data for
      hydrological studies. The pre-trained CNN-Transformer model is built to
      operate independently of SWAT+ models, making it highly accessible for
      diverse applications.

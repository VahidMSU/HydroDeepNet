<h2 class="mb-4">Welcome to the Physically Informed Deep Learning Platform</h2>
<div class="card">
  <div class="card-body">
    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>
      The Physically Informed Deep Learning Platform integrates hydrological
      modeling, hierarchical data management, and advanced deep learning
      techniques to predict hydrological variables at high spatial and temporal
      resolution. This system is designed to enhance our understanding of
      surface and subsurface hydrological processes, with a focus on groundwater
      recharge, evapotranspiration, and surface runoff.
    </p>
    <p>
      The platform combines three key components: (1) physically based
      hydrological modeling using SWAT+, (2) hierarchical data organization and
      preprocessing, and (3) a custom CNN-Transformer architecture for
      spatiotemporal regression. Each stage builds on the other, ensuring
      accuracy, scalability, and adaptability for various hydrological
      applications.
    </p>

    <h3>Key Components</h3>
    <h4>1. Hydrological Modeling with SWAT+</h4>
    <p>
      SWAT+ (Soil and Water Assessment Tool Plus) serves as the foundation for
      generating hydrological outputs. Using the NHDPlus High Resolution (HR)
      dataset, SWAT+ simulates surface and subsurface hydrological cycles across
      multiple watersheds. Key aspects include:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Representation of hydrological processes like evapotranspiration,
        runoff, and groundwater recharge.
      </li>
      <li>
        Use of hierarchical land classifications, from basins to hydrological
        response units (HRUs).
      </li>
      <li>
        Calibration of model parameters using Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)
        to ensure accuracy in predicting observed data.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h4>2. Hierarchical Data Management</h4>
    <p>
      Managing and preprocessing large datasets is crucial for effective
      modeling and analysis. The platform employs a hierarchical database system
      to integrate and standardize data from multiple sources:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        High-resolution datasets, including PRISM (4km), MODIS (250m), NLCD
        (30m), and gSSURGO (30m).
      </li>
      <li>
        Consistent spatial and temporal preprocessing to align data at a 250m
        resolution across Michigan's Lower Peninsula.
      </li>
      <li>
        Gap-filling techniques to handle missing values in remote sensing data,
        ensuring temporal continuity and reliability.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h4>3. Deep Learning with CNN-Transformer Models</h4>
    <p>
      At the core of the platform lies a custom CNN-Transformer architecture
      designed for spatiotemporal regression tasks. This model leverages
      convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for spatial feature extraction and
      Transformers for modeling temporal dependencies. Key features include:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Processing multi-channel spatiotemporal data in tensor format
        [batch_size, time_steps, channels, height, width].
      </li>
      <li>
        Down-sampling and up-sampling pathways with skip connections to preserve
        spatial details.
      </li>
      <li>
        Use of positional encoding and attention mechanisms to capture temporal
        patterns effectively.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Methodology</h3>
    <p>
      The platform follows a systematic approach to integrate hydrological
      modeling, data management, and deep learning:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <b>Generate SWAT+ Models:</b> Predefined hydrological models are created
        using the NHDPlus HR dataset, calibrated with streamflow and other
        observed data. A total of 58 SWAT+ models are implemented across
        Michigan’s Lower Peninsula, covering watersheds ranging from 50 km² to
        3,500 km².
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Preprocess Datasets:</b> Data from multiple sources (MODIS, PRISM,
        NLCD) is aligned spatially and temporally. Missing values are addressed
        through interpolation and averaging techniques, ensuring clean inputs
        for deep learning.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Train CNN-Transformer Models:</b> The deep learning model is trained
        using SWAT+-simulated outputs (e.g., recharge, runoff) alongside
        geospatial and remote sensing datasets. The trained model is then used
        to predict hydrological variables in ungauged watersheds where SWAT+
        model is not available.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Applications</h3>
    <p>
      The Physically Informed Deep Learning Platform is designed to address key
      challenges in hydrology and water resource management:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Predicting groundwater recharge in areas without observational data.
      </li>
      <li>
        Assessing the impacts of climate change on water availability and
        hydrological processes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Providing scalable solutions for watershed-level hydrological modeling
        and analysis.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Educational Value</h3>
    <p>
      Beyond its research applications, this platform serves as a valuable tool
      for education and training in hydrology and machine learning. It
      demonstrates the integration of physically based models with modern deep
      learning approaches, bridging the gap between domain knowledge and
      computational advancements.

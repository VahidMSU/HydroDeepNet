<h2 class="mb-4">Welcome to the Physically Informed Deep Learning Platform</h2>
<div class="card">
  <div class="card-body">
    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>
      The Physically Informed Deep Learning Platform integrates hydrological
      modeling, hierarchical data management, and advanced deep learning
      techniques to predict hydrological variables at high spatial and temporal
      resolution.
    </p>

    <h3>Key Components</h3>

    <h4>1. Hydrological Modeling with SWAT+</h4>
    
    <p>
      SWAT+ (Soil and Water Assessment Tool Plus) serves as the foundation for
      generating hydrological outputs. Using the NHDPlus High Resolution (HR)
      dataset, SWAT+ simulates surface and subsurface hydrological cycles across
      multiple watersheds. Key aspects include:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Representation of hydrological processes like evapotranspiration,
        runoff, and groundwater recharge.
      </li>
      <li>
        Use of hierarchical land classifications, from basins to hydrological
        response units (HRUs).
      </li>
      <li>
        Calibration of model parameters using Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)
        to ensure accuracy in predicting observed data.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h4>2. Hierarchical Data Management</h4>
    <p>
      Managing and preprocessing large datasets is crucial for effective
      modeling and analysis. The platform employs a hierarchical database system
      to integrate and standardize data from multiple sources:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        High-resolution datasets, including PRISM (4km), MODIS (250m), NLCD
        (30m), and gSSURGO (30m).
      </li>
      <li>
        Consistent spatial and temporal preprocessing to align data at a 250m
        resolution across Michigan's Lower Peninsula.
      </li>
      <li>
        Gap-filling techniques to handle missing values in remote sensing data,
        ensuring temporal continuity and reliability.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h4>3. GeoNet Vision System</h4>
    <p>
      The GeoNet is a state-of-the-art deep learning framework tailored for
      hydrological modeling and prediction. Its advanced CNN-Transformer and
      fully Transformer-based architectures process large-scale spatiotemporal
      datasets with exceptional efficiency and accuracy. Key features include:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        A robust data pipeline for handling extensive hydrological datasets,
        ensuring efficient preprocessing, queue management, and seamless data
        flow.
      </li>
      <li>
        Specialized loss functions evaluating both spatial (e.g., boundary loss,
        outlier loss) and temporal components (e.g., seasonal losses).
      </li>
      <li>
        Modularized design supporting flexible hyperparameter configuration,
        logging, and integration for training and inference setups.
      </li>
      <li>
        Deep learning architectures like Inception-LSTM, CNN-Transformers, and
        fully Transformer-based models optimized for spatiotemporal regression
        tasks.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p></p>

    <h3>Applications</h3>
    <p>
      The Physically Informed Deep Learning Platform is designed to address key
      challenges in hydrology and water resource management:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Predicting groundwater recharge in areas without observational data.
      </li>
      <li>
        Assessing the impacts of climate change on water availability and
        hydrological processes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Providing scalable solutions for watershed-level hydrological modeling
        and analysis.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Educational Value</h3>
    <p>
      Beyond its research applications, this platform serves as a valuable tool
      for education and training in hydrology and machine learning. It
      demonstrates the integration of physically based models with modern deep
      learning approaches, bridging the gap between domain knowledge and
      computational advancements.

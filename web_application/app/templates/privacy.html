        This web application is designed to support research and collaboration
        by providing access to hydrological modeling tools and datasets. We
        respect user privacy and are committed to protecting any information
        collected during platform use.
      </p>

      <p>
        We collect user interactions with the application solely for improving
        system functionality, security, and performance. This includes
        authentication logs and feature usage analytics but excludes personally
        identifiable data beyond what is necessary for secure access. All
        passwords are stored securely using encryption standards.
      </p>

      <p>
        User data will not be shared with third parties unless mandated by
        Michigan State Universityâ€™s IT security policies or legal requirements.
        Any data provided for research purposes remains under the ownership of
        the contributing institution or researcher, and its use follows
        applicable agreements.
      </p>

      <p>
        The platform operates entirely on open-source software and integrates
        national datasets, including the National Solar Radiation Database
        (NSRDB), NHDPlus, LANDFIRE, 3D Elevation Program, STATSGO2, and SNODAS.
        We do not collect or process sensitive personal information.
      </p>

      <p>
        By using this application, you acknowledge that minimal system
        interaction data is collected to improve platform reliability. You may
        contact the administrators for questions regarding data policies or
        security measures.
